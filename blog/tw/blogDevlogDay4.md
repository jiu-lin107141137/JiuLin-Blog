# Blog development log - Day 4
Developing my own blog - day 4.

## Tasks completed
Here are what I had done today:
* Add article TOC.
<br>

## Challenge encountered
The problem took me lots of time to solve ~~(yet solved)~~.
### Change the color of TOC based on which section the user is reading

This function includes the following requirements:
* When the user clicks on the section name on TOC, scroll to the section immediately.
* Detect which section the user is reading and change the color of TOC.
* When the page is loaded, jump to the first section.
* When the language is changed, jump to the first section.

The issues encountered:
* After performing click on TOC, the page scrolls to the section right away, but TOC color displayed is abnormal.
* After switching the language, the page jumps to the first section, but TOC color displayed is abnormal.
